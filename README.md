# FizzBuzz
The decent question for an interview

The key is to understand that python stops iterating if it spots a condition that is true, so this question is formulated that if you put i%3 or i%5 in front of i%3 and i%5 the program never check any further to see if the number is also divided by 3 and 5 and says only fizz or buzz, to have the program print out fizzbuzz the first thing that the program should look is for the both conditions to be true and then check if only one condition is true.
